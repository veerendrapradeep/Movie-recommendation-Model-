Problem statement : Movies play a huge role in providing comfort and enjoyment in the entertainment world. It's crucial to have a wide variety of movies available at the right time, so everyone can find something they love and reduce waiting times. Ensuring a consistent supply of movies for the city can be challenging. The key is accurately predicting the demand for different genres and types of movies throughout the day. By analyzing historical data, popular trends, and audience preferences, we can estimate the number of movies needed to maintain a stable supply and enhance the overall movie-watching experience for everyone.
Algorithm Selection:
 In this I am using KNN algorithm as its simple and intuitive algorithm for collaborating filterings.KNN works by finding the k most similar movies to a user’s preferences.
Data Input:
The input features used by the KNN algorithm, such as historical data on  movies, including plot summaries, keywords, themes ,release dates ,actors ,directors and other relevant information.
Training Process:
In this training process I  implemented recommendation systems that are designed to recommend things to the user based on many different factors.
Prediction Process:
This KNN algorithm predits the recommending of movies in the form of rating by using the user preferences for the better prediction
RESULT : The result of my project shows that effectively the KNN algorithm recommends movies based on users' preferences. By analyzing the movies that users have liked or rated highly, the algorithm identifies other users with similar tastes. It then suggests movies that these similar users have enjoyed.
I also used metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score to measure the performance of this algorithm to minimize the incorrect recommendations
The success of your project is determined by the accuracy and effectiveness of the algorithm in recommending movies that users are likely to enjoy.
